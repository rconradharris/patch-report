- Break up background tasks into smaller units

    Units that fetch issues and upstream reviews should work off of a queue
    and refresh relatively often (every 5 minutes)

    discover-repos (once a day)

    refresh-repos (every 5 minutes)
        enqueue any unknown issues
        enqueue any unknown upstream reviews

    Should work off of a queue:
        fetch-issues
        fetch-upstream-reviews

Once a day
    clear-cache

- BUG: Compute-Add-build_instance-hook-in-compute-manager.patch is not handled
  correctly in upstram reviews
    Compute-Do-not-create-block_device_mapping-in-api-ce.patch

- Should upstream-review tag be:
    Upstream-Review: <link>

- Add author filters
- Make rows with 0 patches appear grayed out

- Abstract Issues
    Issue
        RedmineIssue
        GithubIssue
        LaunchpadIssue
        BitbucketIssue

- Abstract UpstreamReviews
    UpstreamReview
        GerritReview
        GithubPullRequest
        BitBucketPullRequest
        EmailReview

CLEANUP

- Add setup.py
- Use shelve?
- separate add and commit from redmine _add_issues
- Use entry points for serve and refresh and clear-cache
- Collect up exceptions in exceptions.py
- Use argparse for command-line options
- Move templates and static out of project directory and up one level

BLOCKED
    Remove pickle hack when this is fixed upstream:
        https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/64 

    https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/pull/60
        - When 1.0.2 is released, change requirement to >= 1.0.2

    ignore_missing_series_file is needed because ncclient is missing series
    file [fix that]
