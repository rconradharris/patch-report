CLEANUP

- Add setup.py
- Use shelve?
- separate add and commit from redmine _add_issues
- Use entry points for serve and refresh and clear-cache
- Collect up exceptions in exceptions.py
- Use argparse for command-line options
- Move templates and static out of project directory and up one level

BLOCKED
    Remove pickle hack when this is fixed upstream:
        https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/64 

    https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/pull/60
        - When 1.0.2 is released, change requirement to >= 1.0.2

    ignore_missing_series_file is needed because ncclient is missing series
    file [fix that]
